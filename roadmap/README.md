# Sonar Migration Tool — Product Roadmap
<!-- updated: 2026-05-26_01:00:00 -->

## Vision

**sonar-migration-tool** is the open-source successor to CloudVoyager — a production-proven SonarQube Server → SonarQube Cloud migration tool. This roadmap captures every capability from CloudVoyager as formal PRD specifications, providing a complete blueprint for any contributor or AI agent to build against.

The end state: a single Go binary that performs **complete, lossless migration** of an entire SonarQube Server installation to SonarQube Cloud — including issues, hotspots, source code, measures, quality configurations, permissions, and all metadata — with zero re-scanning required.

| **P1** | Required for production readiness. Essential for enterprise adoption. | Phase 2 |
| **P2** | Important for usability and completeness. Enhances the migration experience. | Phase 3 |
| **P3** | Nice-to-have. Adds polish and additional interfaces. | Phase 4 |

## Effort Estimates

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Data Migration (SPEC-001 through SPEC-009)
Build the scanner protocol engine and all data extractors/encoders. This is the foundation — everything else builds on top. Start with SPEC-001 (protocol engine), then build SPEC-002 (issues) and SPEC-004 (source code) in parallel, as they exercise different parts of the encoder.

### Phase 2: Version Compatibility & Performance (SPEC-011 through SPEC-016)
Once the core pipeline works for one SQ version, abstract into version-specific pipelines. Add performance optimizations (parallel sync, auto-tuning, rate limiting) to handle production-scale migrations.

### Phase 3: Workflow & Verification (SPEC-017 through SPEC-022)
Enhance the migration workflow with advanced checkpoint/resume, branch migration, and the verification pipeline. Add comprehensive reporting.

### Phase 4: Polish & Desktop (SPEC-023 through SPEC-025)
Build the Electron desktop app, add the sync-metadata command, and enhance configuration validation.

## How to Read These Specs

Each spec follows a consistent structure:

1. **Overview** — What the feature does and why it matters
2. **Problem Statement** — The gap this fills
3. **User Stories** — Who benefits and how
4. **Requirements** — Functional and non-functional requirements
5. **Technical Design** — Architecture, algorithms, API dependencies
6. **Acceptance Criteria** — Testable conditions for "done"
7. **CloudVoyager Reference** — Where to find the reference implementation
8. **Known Limitations** — Documented constraints and workarounds
9. **Open Questions** — Unresolved design decisions

Specs reference each other using `SPEC-XXX` identifiers. Dependencies are explicit — don't start a spec until its dependencies are at least in progress.

## CloudVoyager Reference

The original CloudVoyager implementation lives at:
```
/Users/joshua.quek/Desktop/Active Projects/CloudVoyager Agents/CloudVoyager/
```

Key reference directories:
- `src/pipelines/` — Version-specific extraction and encoding logic
- `src/shared/` — Cross-cutting utilities (state, mapping, reports, config)
- `src/commands/` — CLI command handlers
- `desktop/` — Electron application
- `docs/` — Comprehensive documentation (architecture, key capabilities, troubleshooting)

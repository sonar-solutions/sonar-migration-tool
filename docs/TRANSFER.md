# Using `transfer` — Transfer One Project
<!-- updated: 2026-06-05_10:50:51 -->

`transfer` is the **single-command**, **project-scoped** path. It chains the four phases of a migration — **extract → structure → mappings → migrate** — into one call, then writes a PDF summary on completion. Use it when you have one project (or a small, well-known set of projects) to move across.

Unlike a full `migrate`, `transfer` only touches the **specified project** and the entities it actually uses — its quality gate, its quality profiles, its permissions and project settings, and its complete issue and Security Hotspot history (including externally imported issues). Instance-wide entities such as portfolios, global settings, permission templates, and default gate/profile selection are **not** modified. See [What gets migrated](#what-gets-migrated) below.

If you need fine-grained control, want to review the intermediate files between phases, or are migrating many projects across multiple SonarQube Server instances, see [Using `migrate`](MIGRATE.md) instead.

---

## When to use it

- Migrating a single project from SonarQube Server to SonarQube Cloud.
- Quick one-off moves where you don't need to review intermediate files.
- Smoke-testing the tool against a known project before a larger migration.

If any of these sound like you, jump to [MIGRATE.md](MIGRATE.md) instead:

- Multiple SonarQube Server instances.
- You want to inspect or edit the mapping CSVs before pushing.
- You want to run the phases at different times (e.g., extract on a Friday, migrate on a Monday).
- You want to resume a partial migration after a failure.

## What it does
<!-- updated: 2026-06-05_14:00:00 -->

Behind the scenes, `transfer` runs the same four phases as the manual workflow, in order:

1. **Extract** — connects to SonarQube Server and pulls the project's configuration **and its full issue/hotspot scan history** (scan history is always included for `transfer`).
2. **Structure** — assembles the extracted data into the project + org structure.
3. **Mappings** — generates the per-entity mapping CSVs (gates, profiles, groups, templates, portfolios).
4. **Migrate** — applies the **project-scoped** subset to SonarQube Cloud: it runs only the tasks needed for the project, its quality gate and profiles, its permissions, and its issue/hotspot history. Their dependencies are resolved automatically; global/instance-wide tasks are skipped.

On completion, a migration summary is written into the export directory as both `migration_summary.pdf` and `migration_summary.md`, alongside the run instrumentation files (`run_meta.json`, `run_events.jsonl`). These are written even when the run fails, so the summary can explain the failure.

## What gets migrated
<!-- updated: 2026-06-05_12:26:41 -->

`transfer` migrates a **project-scoped** slice, not the whole instance.

**Included:**

- The specified **project** (created in the target organization).
- The **quality gate** the project uses, with its conditions.
- The **quality profiles** the project uses, with their rules restored (and any parent relationships).
- The project's **permissions** (group permissions), **settings**, **tags**, **links**, **webhooks**, and **new code period**.
- The project's complete **issue history** — both native SonarQube issues and **externally imported issues** (from third-party analyzers) — replayed via scan-history import, with triage state (status, resolution, assignee, comments, tags) synced afterward.
- The project's **Security Hotspots**, with their review status and comments synced.

**Not modified** (use the full [`migrate`](MIGRATE.md) command for these):

- Portfolios.
- Global settings, global webhooks, and the global new code period.
- Permission templates and default-template assignment.
- Organization-level and profile-level group permissions.
- Default quality gate / default quality profile selection.
- Rule tag and rule description updates.
- ALM / DevOps platform repository bindings.

> **Note on prerequisites.** A few global entities are created on the target only because the project depends on them — for example, the groups referenced by the project's group permissions, and the migration user/permissions used to perform the migration. These are created as needed so the project's own configuration resolves correctly.

> **Note on issue counts.** The target issue count is normally lower than the SonarQube Server total because issues that are **CLOSED** or resolved as **FIXED** have no SonarQube Cloud counterpart and are intentionally skipped (the scanner report only recreates active findings). Open issues plus triaged ones (won't-fix / false-positive / accepted) and all externally-imported issues are migrated. Security Hotspots transfer in full.

> **Non-main branches.** Scan-history import now migrates the project's **non-main branches too** — each is created on SonarQube Cloud as a **long-lived branch with its full issue history**. Before submitting a non-main branch's report, the tool performs SonarQube Cloud's **"Create analysis" handshake** (`POST {api-host}/analysis/analyses`) to register the branch and obtain an analysis id, which it embeds in the report so the Compute Engine binds the issues to the branch. All migrated branches are registered as **long-lived** so SonarQube Cloud's automatic pruning of short-lived branches (after ~30 days) never discards migrated history. A non-main branch is **skipped** only when the source server no longer has its source code (e.g. purged by housekeeping for an inactive branch) — re-analyze that branch on the source first to restore it. See [CLOUDVOYAGER-DELTA.md](CLOUDVOYAGER-DELTA.md) (BUG-17) for the investigation.

## Quick start

### With a config file

```bash
# From source
cd go && go run . transfer -c config.json

# Built binary
sonar-migration-tool transfer -c config.json
```

`config.json` uses the **same unified shape** as `extract` and `migrate` — one top-level block of shared defaults plus `source` and `target` sub-objects. See [ADVANCED-CONFIG.md](ADVANCED-CONFIG.md) for the full reference.

Minimal form:

```json
{
  "source": {
    "url": "https://sonarqube.example.com",
    "token": "sqp_xxx"
  },
  "target": {
    "token": "squ_xxx",
    "default_organization": "my-org"
  }
}
```

Full form:

```json
{
  "concurrency": 25,
  "timeout": 60,
  "export_directory": "./migration-files",
  "project_key": "my-project",
  "source": {
    "url": "https://sonarqube.example.com",
    "token": "sqp_xxx",
    "pem_file_path": "/path/to/cert.pem",
    "key_file_path": "/path/to/cert.key",
    "cert_password": "optional"
  },
  "target": {
    "url": "https://sonarcloud.io/",
    "token": "squ_xxx",
    "default_organization": "my-org",
    "enterprise_key": "my-enterprise"
  }
}
```

### With CLI flags

```bash
# From source
cd go && go run . transfer \
  --source_url https://sonarqube.example.com \
  --source_token sqp_xxx \
  --project_key my-project \
  --target_token squ_xxx \
  --default_organization my-org

# Built binary
sonar-migration-tool transfer \
  --source_url https://sonarqube.example.com \
  --source_token sqp_xxx \
  --project_key my-project \
  --target_token squ_xxx \
  --default_organization my-org
```

Omit `--project_key` to transfer **every** project visible to the token (in which case the rest of the manual workflow applies — see [MIGRATE.md](MIGRATE.md) for the per-project `organizations.csv` mapping step).

## Output
<!-- updated: 2026-06-05_14:00:00 -->

- **Intermediate files** — written to `--export_dir` (default `./migration-files/`). Same files as the manual workflow: `organizations.csv`, `gates.csv`, `profiles.csv`, `groups.csv`, `templates.csv`, `portfolios.csv`.
- **`migration_summary.pdf`** — PDF migration summary, written to the export directory on completion.
- **`migration_summary.md`** — Markdown rendering of the same summary, written alongside the PDF on completion.
- **`run_meta.json`** — per-phase / per-task timing and `overall_status` (`success` | `partial` | `failed`) for the run, written to the run directory on completion (including failed runs, so the summary can explain the failure).
- **`run_events.jsonl`** — JSON Lines stream of run events (one record per line) mirrored from the logger by the tee slog handler; the summary collector parses these to build the report.
- **Stdout** — every command prints `See sonar-migration-tool output results in <directory>` when it finishes so you always know where to look.

For a full description of every output file, see the [Output Files Reference](MIGRATE.md#output-files-reference) in MIGRATE.md.

## After the transfer
<!-- updated: 2026-06-05_10:50:51 -->

1. Log in to SonarQube Cloud and confirm the project appears under the target organization.
2. Spot-check that the quality gate and quality profile are present.
3. Spot-check that issues and hotspots came across (compare counts against the source). Scan history is always imported, so a fresh re-scan is not required to seed historical data — though you should still run a normal analysis once your pipeline is repointed.
4. Update your CI/CD pipeline to point at SonarQube Cloud (`SONAR_TOKEN`, `SONAR_HOST_URL`).

For more on post-migration steps, see the [After you migrate](MIGRATE.md#after-you-migrate) section in MIGRATE.md.

## Troubleshooting

- **Token errors** — see the [Token permissions](MIGRATE.md#token-permissions) section in MIGRATE.md.
- **Org not found** — confirm `--default_organization` matches an existing organization in your SonarQube Cloud enterprise.
- **Anything else** — [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) has the full list of common errors.
